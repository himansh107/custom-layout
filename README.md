## Connect section for circuit extraction 
</p>

The connect section of the tech file describes how different tile types are connected to each other and the electrical connections between them </p>

### Illustration 
</p>

The code below is the connect section of the .tech file. It shows one instance connections </p>
![connect section ](https://github.com/himansh107/custom-layout/assets/75253218/093cb406-036b-41d1-baf1-d92e85bd4a4e) </p>

- nwell - nwell tile 
- nsc/a - n substrate contact of the active plane 
- nsd - n substrate diffusion </p>

Writing all three seperated by comma means that they are mutually connected. Repeating the same with space in between denotes that there is a electrical flow of current between them. </p>

Similarly, in the picture above the polysilicon (poly) is connected to all fets and polysilicon contact of the active plane and there is electrical current flow between these connections </p>
